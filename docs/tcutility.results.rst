tcutility.results
=======================

The tcutility.results package enables you to easily retrieve information and results from a calculation done using AMS.
This includes results and settings from AMS as well as the calculation engine used (e.g. ADF, BAND, DFTB, ...).
Recommended usage is to use the |read| function to read the information.
One can also access specific information by calling one the functions in the submodules below.
Information will be given as :class:`tcutility.results.result.Result` objects and can be used just like a `dict`_.

    >>> import TCutility.results
    >>> calc_dir = '../test/fixtures/ethanol'
    >>> info = TCutility.results.read(calc_dir)
    >>> info.engine

    >>> info.ams_version.full
